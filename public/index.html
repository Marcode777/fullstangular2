<!-- left off at 4:59 of YouTube Video MEANSTACK RESTFUL API TUTORIAL (2/5) from Learn Coding Tutorials , it won't display the data from controller.js for some reason. Update! It was because contactlist was misspelled as contaclist, instead of contactlist = ) -->
<!-- ng-app = "myApp" initiates angular. 
to test if controller.js is working, console.log a message and look for it in inspect under the console tab
ng-controller = "AppCtrl" is for the controller.js (server)
contactlist is declared in controller.js and contains an array
ng-repeat = "contact in contactlist", allows to loop through array, and also allows the objects into separate rows, contacts in contactlist (in other methods from others is in the form of plural in singular (contacts in contactlist), but here it's contact in contactlist, and also as long as they're the same in ng-repeat and in the td). In other words, whatever first word is used in the phrase " _____ in contactlist" will work as long as it's the same as in front of name, email, and number, e.g.  _____.name, ____.email, _____.number.
